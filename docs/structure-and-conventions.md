# Repository Structure and Conventions

This document expands on the folder structure and naming conventions used in WebExperiments.

---

## Folder Structure

Root layout:

```
WebExperiments/
  README.md
  docs/
  experiments/
  resources/
  raw-assets/
  .gitignore
  .gitattributes
```

---

## Naming Conventions

Use **kebab-case** for folders and files:

```
threejs-playground
ui-prototype-01
webgl-tests
raw-assets
```

JavaScript naming:

- camelCase — variables and functions  
- PascalCase — classes  
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE — constants  

This style is consistent, easy to read, and works across all platforms.
